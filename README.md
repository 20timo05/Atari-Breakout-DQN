# Solving Atari Breakout Environment using Deep Reinforcement Learning

The goal of the agent is to break as many bricks as possible. To achieve this, the agent has to move a paddle at the bottom of the screen to deflect the ball upward toward the bricks. After sufficient training, I expect the agent to learn advanced strategies, such as targeting the bricks near the walls to create an opening that allows the ball to pass through and get above the remaining bricks. Once the ball is above the bricks, it can continue bouncing and breaking multiple bricks on its own, maximizing efficiency and score.

# Purpose

This project exists solely to apply what I've learned about DQNs to a more challenging task than Cart & Pole.
